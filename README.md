Providing a framework for answering Quranic questions, based on the creation of five-word
The Holy Quran is an educational, man-making book, which was revealed for both individual and society development, in all spiritual and material aspects. One of the characteristics of Quran is responding different needs of human beings in various eras. Therefore, there is a need for a system which has the ability to respond to users’ needs and questions regarding Quranic context. The most important issue in these type of systems is that these systems must be able to answer either users’ question or demands in a concise and short manner without providing in any unnecessary details. A system, with limited scope of question and answer, based on the extraction of five-word, in the official Persian language, specific to Quaranic questions, with short answers has been provided on this paper. This system has four main stages. a- Creating a knowledge base; b- input question processing; c- Retrieving data; d- Selecting answers based on extracted relationships. Taking advantage of using dependency analysis tools, at the stage of (a) creating a knowledge base, has been resulted in sentences analyzation, based on the five major components as well as store in database. By generating five-word input sentences which have been converted into Declarative Sentences, at the stage (b) input question process, this tool enhances the possibility of matching between question and answer, which resulted in a more favorable output.
 Considering the fact that the input of this tool is a Declarative Sentence, therefore an Interrogative Sentence is automatically convert into a Declarative Sentence. In this level, the use of question type detection, optimizes the response time, hence reduces the system possible errors in response.
Experimenting the proposed method on 313 database questions cases, extracted form Persian translation of “Yusuf”, “Rahman” and “Noah” Surahs, leads us to this conclusion that, the desired method on this research was able to answer existing database questions by 87.2% of accuracy. And compared to other proposed methods in the limited Quranic domain and answering questions of the factoid type, it has been able to perform better by 4.91% in the criterion of accuracy and also in the criterion of average mutual score.
